* Introduction

This package extends [[https://github.com/localauthor/][`zk` and `zk-index`]] to include support for working with
files assigned Luhmann-style IDs.

A demo of this package can be viewed here: https://youtu.be/O6iSV4pQQ5g

Currently this package defines Luhmann-style IDs as alphanumeric sequences
between curly braces. They look like this: {1,1,b,3 }

Note the space after the final character. This is necessary for proper
sorting.

The ID is part of the file-name, positioned between the zk-id and the
title.

Because all files with Luhmann-IDs have normal zk-ids, they are normal
zk-files. This naming and ID scheme therefore simply offers a different
organizing scheme within a zk. It is both fully integrated with zk while
being, nevertheless, completely distinct --- a system within a system.
